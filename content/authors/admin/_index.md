I am an Economist at the [Swiss Federal Department of Financ](https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home.html) in Financial Statistics. My research interests focus on information frictions, expectation formations and macroprudential regulation.

I finished my PhD at the [University of Lausanne, HEC](https://www.unil.ch/hec/en/home.html), in September 2023. During my PhD, I was a scientific collaborator at the [CREA Swiss Institute of Applied Economics](https://www.unil.ch/crea/fr/home.html). Finished projects include quarterly forecasting of industry exports and the development of a News Sentiment Index with a novel database in Switzerland.

Before starting my PhD, I was an intern at the Financial Stability Division of the [Swiss National Bank](https://www.snb.ch/) where I returned to for a research collaboration as part of my PhD.

From November 2022 to April 2023, I joined the Macro Financial Division at the [Central Bank of Ireland](https://www.centralbank.ie/)  for a research internship.
