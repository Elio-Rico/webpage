I am PhD Student in Economics at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/hec/en/home.html/). I am particularly interested in research related to information frictions, expectation formations and macroprudential regulation.

Besides that, I am a scientific collaborator at the [CREA Swiss Institute of Applied Economics](https://www.unil.ch/crea/fr/home.html). Projects include forecasting exports of specific industries and the development of a News Sentiment Index with a novel database in Switzerland.
