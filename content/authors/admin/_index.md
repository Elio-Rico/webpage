I am PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/hec/en/home.html/). My research interests focus on information frictions, expectation formations and macroprudential regulation.

Besides that, I am a scientific collaborator at the [CREA Swiss Institute of Applied Economics](https://www.unil.ch/crea/fr/home.html). Finished and ongoing projects include quarterly forecasting of industry exports and the development of a News Sentiment Index with a novel database in Switzerland.

Before starting my PhD, I was an intern at the Financial Stability Division of the Swiss National Bank where I returned to for a research collaboration as part of my PhD.

From November 2022 to April 2023, I will be joining the Macro Financial Division at the Central Bank of Ireland for a research internship.
