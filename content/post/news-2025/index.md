I am delighted to see the paper "The Effect of Macroprudential Policies on Homeownership: Evidence from Switzerland" accepted at JUE and the paper "Do Local Forecasters Have Better Information?" conditionally accepted at The Review of Economics and Statistics. Updated versions of the paper on this webpage coming soon!
