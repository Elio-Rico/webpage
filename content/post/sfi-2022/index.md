From June 13-14nd 2022, the ["SFI Research Days 2022"](https://www.sfi.ch/de/faculty/research-days/) took place in Gerzensee, Switzerland. I had the immense pleasure to present our paper about "Dissecting the Home Bias in Survey Expectations". I thank the discussant, Qingyuan Yang, for his helpful suggestions and critique and the outstanding chair of the session David Thesmar, the participants Daron Acemoglu, Andreas Fuster and Harald Hau for the lively discussion and the extremely valuable feedback/comments. A big thanks to the organizers for this wonderful conference.
