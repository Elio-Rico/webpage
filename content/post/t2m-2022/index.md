From April 21-22nd 2022, the ["Theories and Methods in Macroeconomics Conference 2022"](https://t2m2022.sciencesconf.org/) takes place in London. Our paper "Dissecting the Home bias in Survey Expectations" has been selected. I am very much looking forward to the presentation, inputs and discussions at this conference.
