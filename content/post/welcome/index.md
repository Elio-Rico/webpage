Welcome to my new website. I changed my old [github.io](https://elio-rico.github.io/) website to this one. At the same time, I changed the domain. For anybody interested in creating a website with blogdown I recommend following the documentation of [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/templates/). For my old website on github, I used templates of [html5up](https://html5up.net/massively). I hope you enjoy the new layout and structure of this page and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback on the content.
