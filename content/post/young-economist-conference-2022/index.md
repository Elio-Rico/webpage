From the 17th to the 18th February, 2022, the Young Swiss Economist Meeting will take place (online). Our paper "The Effects of Macroprudential Policies on Homeownership: Evidence from Switzerland" was randomly allocated to a poster session (versus presentation). I am looking forward to the discussions and the presentation of all peers at this event!
