<h1>Framework</h1>
<p>In the exercise, I was provided with monthly export data of a Swiss industry. The aim was to forecast exports for several different regions, including Europe, the United States as well as total exports. In this short project description, I will focus on the procedure to forecast total exports of the Swiss industry.</p>
<p>Below, the figure shows the original series of total exports of this Swiss industry. The series shows strong seasonality and a positive trend over time. The series starts in 1993 and total exports peak in october 2014 at 2.28 billion CHF.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>To match the frequency of additional variables used in further analysis, I averaged the monthly time series to quarterly data. As the forecast-horizon of interest was 1.5 years, I proceeded to detrend the time series to focus more on the medium-term evolution of the exports. The de-trending of the time series allows to purge the series of seasonality and abstract from short-term shocks that have no persisting effect.</p>
<p>To detrend, I used a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on LOESS. In a nutshell, this approach uses locally-weighted regressions as a smoother on the time series (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-cleveland1990stl" role="doc-biblioref">Cleveland et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-cleveland1990stl" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span>). It allows to decompose a time series in trend component, seaonsal compent and a remainder. Below, I plot the filtered trend data in quarterly frequency together with the original monthly time series.</p>

<p>Before the model evaulation exercise, I selected several variables that correlate well with the export time series. As we are only interested in an accurate forecast and not the causal relationship between variables, including variables that correlate well with the variable of interest in the forecasting model can improve the model fit. However, correlation should be strong as including arbitrary series may increase noise and decrease the model’s performance. Also, including too many variables may increase the in-sample fit but may lead to poor out-of-sample fit. If the model is overfit, it represents data patterns that are specific to the sample used.</p>
<p>Displayed below are the growth rates of some variables that I considered in the forecasting
exercise. It shows the growth rates of our series of interset, the total exports of the Swiss industry,
the total exports of all sectors in Switzerland, and the real GDP growth of the region of interest
(in this case, the GDP growth of the world).</p>

<div id="evaluation" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Next, I present several models that I considered during the evaluation process.
I show how I evaluated which models were most suitable and how I compared the
forecasting accuracy across models.</p>
<p>I considered the following models: Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA),
ARMA with exogenous inputs (ARMAX), Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR), VAR with exogenous
inputs (VARX), VAR with Moving-Average (VARMA). Note that this list
is in no means exhaustive regarding models suitable for forecasting exercises. However,
they have proven to fit considerably well in a first evaluation for the specific
time series of interest. In what follows, I briefly describe the models.</p>
<div id="arma" class="section level3">
<h3>ARMA</h3>
<p>As a first model, I considered a simple ARMA(p) representation. The model can be represented as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> is the series of interest, <span class="math inline">\(p,q\)</span> are the number of lags considered. <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> represent the estimated coefficients
for the auto-regressive (AR) part, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are the coefficients of the moving average (MA) and $ { <em>t}</em>{t] -,+[} $ is
a white noise process. <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant.</p>
</div>
<div id="armax" class="section level3">
<h3>ARMAX</h3>
<p>The ARMAX(p,q) is a simple extension of the ARMA model in that sense that it allows for additional regressors
to be considered in the model estimation. Formally, it is written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \beta_0 x_t + \dots \beta_r x_{t-r} + \dots \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 x_t + \dots \beta_r x_{t-r}\)</span> is a matrix containing all additional variables considered (GDP growth and growth of total exports, as an example) and
potential lags of these variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="var" class="section level3">
<h3>VAR</h3>
<p>The VAR(p) is the multi-dimensional analogue to the the AR model. While in the AR model, only one equation
is considered at the time, the VAR estimates multiple equations simultaneously. Formally, we can represent a VAR
in the following way</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = c + \Phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \Phi_p y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is a vector of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and the matrices <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> are of dimension <span class="math inline">\(k \times k\)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> would contain
observations for our main variable of interest, the exports of a Swiss industry, and GDP growth (and hence <span class="math inline">\(k = 2\)</span>).
Each variable consists of observations from time <span class="math inline">\(t = 1 \dots T\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> are vecotrs of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="varx" class="section level3">
<h3>VARX</h3>
<p>VARX(p) extend the VAR by allowing for additional exogenous regressors in the system of equations that are not dynamically dependent of each other. Formally, this is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = c + \Phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \Phi_p y_{t-p} + B x_{t} \varepsilon_t\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(x_{t}\)</span> being a vector of the exogenous variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="varma" class="section level3">
<h3>VARMA</h3>
<p>Finally, the VARMA(p,q) model is the multi-dimneinsional analogue to the ARMA model. Formally, this this can be described as
<span class="math display">\[y_t = c + \Phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \Phi_p y_{t-p} +  \varepsilon_t + \Theta  \varepsilon_t + \Theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \Theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="selection-of-the-model---in-sample-forecasts" class="section level2">
<h2>Selection of the model - in-sample forecasts</h2>
<p>For each of the model, I did several forecasting exercises. In particular, I calculated the in-sample forecasts for all of the models
and compared the outcome with the actual variable. For in-sample forecasting, I restricted the time series to an arbitrary
time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> where $1 &lt; t &lt; T $ and then estimated the model with different specifications. As I observe the actual outcome of the
time series of interest for all periods <span class="math inline">\(\geq t\)</span> until $ T $ I could compare the forecast with the actual outcome. I did the in-sample
forecasting exercise for various combinations of exogenous variables and different lag-selection for both endogenous and exogenous variables.</p>
<p>As an example, below I compare the in-sample forecast of VARMA model to an ARAMX.</p>
