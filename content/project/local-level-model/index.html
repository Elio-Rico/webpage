<h1>Framework</h1>
<p>In the exercise, I was provided with monthly export data of a Swiss industry. The aim was to forecast exports for several different regions, including Europe, the United States as well as total exports. In this short project description, I will focus on the procedure to forecast total exports of the Swiss industry.</p>
<p>Below, the figure shows the original series of total exports of this Swiss industry. The series shows strong seasonality and a positive trend over time. The series starts in 1993 and total exports peak in october 2014 at 2.28 billion CHF.</p>
