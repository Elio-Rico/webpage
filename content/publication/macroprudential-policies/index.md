abstract: This paper analyzes how the introduction of macroprudential policies in the Swiss residential mortgage market affected the propensity of households to become homeowners. We exploit a unique administrative data set of individual tax records containing detailed financial and socio-demographic information. We show that the annual share of renter households transitioning into homeownership decreased from 3.6\% prior to the introduction  of the policies to 3.0\% afterward, and present evidence suggesting that this drop is, at least partly, due the these policies. Specifically, the relative decrease in transition into homeownership has been much larger for lower-wealth households, and predeath bequests have become more important for homebuying both at the extensive and the intensive margin. The effect is especially pronounced for younger households. As family wealth is heterogeneous, the introduction of macroprudential policies may entail distributional consequences.
