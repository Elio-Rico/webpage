abstract: "This paper uses a novel dataset in Switzerland to study asymmetric effects of newspaper reporting with respect to inflation. Using a non-linear time series model, we document a media negativity bias in French written newspapers, but find no evidence for newspapers written in German. Furthermore, we find that media tone shocks effect inflation expectations more for households located in the French speaking part compared to the German speaking part of Switzerland, suggesting that the media bias in newspapers affects inflation expectations. Finally, we find that information about inflation decrease is more informative than information about an inflation increase."
